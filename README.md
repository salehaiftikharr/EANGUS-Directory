## How It Works

### Admin Dashboard

1. After installing the plugin, admins will see a **‚ÄúLeadership Directory‚Äù** tab in the WP admin menu.
2. Inside this tab are forms for each directory section.
3. Admins can add new entries via secure, sanitized input forms.
4. Data is inserted directly into custom database tables (`wp_sdp_*`).

### Front-End Display

1. Add any of the shortcodes to a page (e.g. `[state_directory]`).
2. The plugin will render a **Tailwind-styled**, fully responsive layout.
3. Filters by **Area** and **State** allow users to narrow down the directory.
4. Toggle buttons expand/collapse content as needed.

## Installation

1. Upload the plugin to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate it from the WordPress Plugin Dashboard.
3. Visit **Leadership Directory** in the admin menu to begin adding entries.
4. Add `[state_directory]` or other shortcode to any page or post to display.
