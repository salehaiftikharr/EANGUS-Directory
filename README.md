## How It Works

### Admin Dashboard

   - Area Chairs
   - State Leadership
   - Past Presidents
   - Annual Conferences
3. Admins can add new entries via secure, sanitized input forms with helpful placeholders and instructions.
4. Data is stored in a unified `wp_eangus_directory` table with automatic duplicate handling.

### Front-End Display

2. The plugin renders a fully responsive, interactive directory with:
   - **Hero section** with navigation links to different sections
   - **Collapsible sections** that can be expanded/collapsed by users
   - **Alphabetical grouping** for states and decades for historical data
   - **Area-based organization** for geographical leadership structure
   - **Professional styling** with cards, buttons, and smooth transitions
